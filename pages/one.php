								<p style = "text-align:center; ">STEP 1: CHECK THE SURROUNDINGS.</p>
								<p> Evaluate the situation. Are there things that might put you at risk of harm? Are you or the victim threatened by fire, toxic smoke or gasses, an unstable building, live electrical wires or other dangerous scenario? Do not rush into a situation where you could end up as a victim yourself.If approaching the victim will endanger your life, seek professional help immediately; they have higher levels of training and know how to handle these situations. First aid becomes useless if you can't safely perform it without hurting yourself.</p><br>

								<p style = "text-align:center;">STEP 2: CALL FOR HELP.</p>
								<p>Call authorities or emergency services immediately if you believe someone to be seriously injured. If you are the only person on the scene, try to establish breathing in the patient before calling for help. Do not leave the victim alone for an extensive amount of time.</p><br>

								<span class="image main"><img src="assets/images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style = "text-align:center;">STEP 3: CARE FOR THE PERSON.</p>
								<p>Caring for someone who has just gone through serious trauma includes both physical treatment and emotional support. Remember to stay calm and try to be reassuring; let the person know that help is on its way and that everything will be alright.</p><br>
